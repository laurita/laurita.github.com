	<h2>
		Hi! My name is Laura.
	</h2>
		
	<p class="bio">	
		I am a programmer enthusiastic about functional reactive coding. I mostly write Scala, though I really admire O'Caml as well. I know a bit about recommender systems, statistics and math. Apart from programming, I like <a target="empty" href="http://vagabonds.lambda.lt/">rock climbing</a> and <a target="empty" href="http://www.movescount.com/members/_lrb_">trail running</a>.
			
		I did my BSc in Financial and Actuarial Mathematics in Vinius University, where with several friends I wrote a thesis about <a target="empty" href="/assets/BSc.pdf">The Role of Tail Index in Analysis of Currency Returns</a>. After that I shifted gears and started programming.
			
		At the moment I am about to finish my MSc in Computer Science at the Free University of Bozen - Bolzano. I have just finished a thesis about <a target="empty" href="/assets/MSc.pdf">Pairwise Preferences in Collaborative Filtering</a>. Now I am spending most of my time at <a target="empty" href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> in New York and I am totally enjoying it.
