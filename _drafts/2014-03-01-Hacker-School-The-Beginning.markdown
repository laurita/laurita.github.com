Acouple of months ago I got accepted to Hacker School and as a result I am now in New York for three months. Since then I got quite a few questions and/or remarks on what I am doing here. So let me fist explain briefly what Hacker School is.

HS calls itself a "writers' retreat for programmers" and frankly it really describes the atmosphere very well. It is a place which gathers around 60 trully passionate people into one place and allows them to develop themselves in various ways with the same aim in mind - to become a better programmer. For some it means hacking Linux kernel, for others developing a game in JavaScript. But no matter what you are doing, you are doing it because it is fun. Not because your boss told you, not because a customer needs a feature fast, not because the assignment requires that, but because you want to do it. And that is the key to success!

There are not many rules here. Actually, probably just four.
